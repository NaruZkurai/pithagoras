/**
 * A blast-radius limiter for prompt injection.
 *
 * The premise is that the model *will* eventually follow instructions hidden in
 * content it reads — an email, a web page, an issue comment. Nothing in a system
 * prompt reliably prevents that, so this does not try. It limits what a turn can
 * do after it has read something untrusted.
 *
 * Two halves:
 *
 * 1. `tool_result` — output from a source that carries other people's words is
 *    wrapped in an envelope saying so, and the session is marked tainted.
 * 2. `tool_call` — once tainted, the handful of actions that turn a bad
 *    suggestion into a lasting problem are refused.
 *
 * Enforcement is tainted-only on purpose. A session writing code in a repository
 * never sees any of this; the rules apply exactly where the risk appeared. The
 * cost is that an injection arriving in the first message — a stranger messaging
 * a bot with no allowlist — is not covered by the taint, only by the envelope.
 *
 * These are heuristics. A determined attacker who already has a shell can work
 * around a pattern list. The point is to make the easy path stop working, and to
 * make an attempt visible instead of silent.
